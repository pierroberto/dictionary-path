# How did you approach this problem?

I have read the problem and tried to understand it. Then I wrote down on a paper the logic in order to find the solution of the example. Then I tried to apply that solution to more general cases and finally I wrote the code.

# How did you check that your solution is correct?

I implemented some tests so that I just needed to run `npm test` to check if they passed or not.

# Specify any assumption that you have made

I did not add any further assumption to the one already existing.
